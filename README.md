# **Behavioral Analysis of User Phone Usage Metrics (ML)**

Created in Google Colab.

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - California Housuing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset)

### **Overview**
This project conducts a behavioral analysis on user phone usage metrics. The objective is to identify correlations between various phone usage metrics and user behavior.

### **Dataset Summary**
- **Sample Size**: 700 entries (n = 700)

- **Features**:
  - **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.<br>
  - **Device Model**: Model of the user's smartphone.<br>
  - **Operating System**: OS of the device (iOS or Android).<br>
  - **App Usage Time**: Daily time spent on mobile applications, measured in minutes.<br>
  - **Screen On Time**: Average hours per day the screen is active.<br>
  - **Battery Drain**: Daily battery consumption in mAh.<br>
  - **Number of Apps Installed**: Total apps available on the device.<br>
  - **Data Usage**: Daily mobile data consumption in megabytes.<br>
  - **Age**: Age of the user.<br>
  - **Gender**: Gender of the user (Male or Female).<br>
  - **User Behavior Class**: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns from Light (1) to Extreme (5) usage.

  The data was divided into four clusters, each representing a different level of device usage. The clusters are color-coded in the visualizations as follows:

- **Cluster 0**: Light Users (Light Purple)
  - **App Usage Time**: < 200 minutes/day
  - **Battery Drain**: < 500 mAh/day
  - **Screen On Time**: < 2 hours/day
  - **Data Usage**: < 500 MB/day
  - **Characteristics**: Light users who engage with their devices minimally, likely for simple tasks like messaging or checking emails.
- **Cluster 1**: Moderate Users (Pink)
  - **App Usage Time**: 200-400 minutes/day
  - **Battery Drain**: 500-1000 mAh/day
  - **Screen On Time**: 4-6 hours/day
  - **Data Usage**: 500 MB - 1 GB/day
  - **Characteristics**: Users who engage in moderate device use, likely for social media, browsing, and casual streaming.
- **Cluster 2**: Heavy Users (Darker Purple)
  - **App Usage Time**: 400-600 minutes/day
  - **Battery Drain**: 1000-2000 mAh/day
  - **Screen On Time**: 6-10 hours/day
  - **Data Usage**: 1 GB - 2 GB/day
  - **Characteristics**: Heavy users who engage in activities such as frequent video consumption, online gaming, or multitasking.
- **Cluster 3**: Power Users (Darkest Purple)
  - **App Usage Time**: > 600 minutes/day
  - **Battery Drain**: > 2000 mAh/day
  - **Screen On Time**: > 10 hours/day
  - **Data Usage**: > 2 GB/day
  - **Characteristics**: Power users with extreme reliance on their devices, likely for work, streaming, or gaming. They exhibit the highest battery drain and data usage.

### **Analysis and Models**
1. **Logistic Regression Model**:
   - Predicts **Battery Drain (mAh/day)**.
   - Trained using **App Usage Time (min/day)**, **Screen On Time (hours/day)**, and **Data Usage (MB/day)**.

2. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - Developed as a comparison to the logistic regression model for predicting battery drain and examining model performance.
  
A histogram is done to visualize distribution of ages which shows equal distribution.

A scatterplot is done to see if there is any correrlation between age and number of apps installed. No correlation is visualized.

A boxplot is used to visualzie the distributuion between genders which shows near equal distribution.
